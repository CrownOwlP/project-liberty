## Active work

- **PW-0501** [IN_PROGRESS] A Windows build that CI actually produces — owner: claude-infra

## Dispatch classification

- **READY_AND_EXECUTABLE:** 8
- **READY_BUT_EXTERNAL:** 0
- **BLOCKED:** 3
- **BACKLOG (dependency-gated):** 12

## Recommended executable wave

- **PL-0406** -> claude-backend (P1/Backend) The documented migration command applies nothing and exits 0
- **PW-0304** -> claude-frontend (P1/Frontend) Watchlist becomes usable: an add control and a list
- **PW-0307** -> claude-frontend (P1/Frontend) Series navigation and the next episode
- **PL-AI-0014** -> claude-lead (P2/Coordination) An option-looking event type is a usage error, not an event

## Queued for external agents

No READY work is waiting on an external agent lane.

## Blockers

- **PL-0302** First production provider: Requires a confirmed licensed API/provider and credentials
- **PL-0602** Live provider integration: Requires licensed live feed/provider access
- **PW-0103** Experiment 1a: can a child HWND composite beneath the webview: Requires the commander's real Windows hardware, which no agent in this session can reach. This is a RECORDING of a fact already in coordination/LAST_MILE.md item 7, not a new judgement, and it is trivially reversible with unblock if gpt-architect disagrees.

THE FACT. PW-0103 is Experiment 1a: whether a child HWND composites beneath the WebView2. It needs a Windows machine with a GPU and a display. The cloud session has none: the linked computer exposes an isolated LINUX VM, and this container's Rust toolchain targets x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu only, so no Windows binary can be built or run here at all. A windows-latest CI runner substitutes for a BUILD machine (that is PW-0501) and for nothing else -- it has no display to composite onto and no human to look at one. LAST_MILE item 7 has said so since it was written, and it says the harder thing too: the whole choice of Tauri rests on this experiment and it has never been run, so a failure reverses decision D1 rather than being worked around.

WHY IT IS BEING RECORDED NOW RATHER THAN LEFT. While PW-0103 sat in READY, ai-control-plane dispatch listed it as dispatchable-now to claude-media and deferred PW-0501 behind it on an allowedPaths overlap. PW-0501 is the task gpt-architect named as wave item 2 in the round-91 verdict -- 'A Windows build that CI actually produces' -- and it is the one downstream of everything in the Windows phase. So the board was advertising, as this session's next available work, a task this session provably cannot perform, and holding back the task it can. A board that says a thing is dispatchable when it is not is worse than one that says it is blocked.

WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a claim that PW-0103 is unimportant, and not a request to descope it: it is the experiment the architecture rests on. It is a claim about WHO can run it. The owner action is in LAST_MILE item 7 and is unchanged.

UNBLOCK WHEN: the commander runs Experiment 1a on real Windows hardware and hands back the result, or gpt-architect rules that some part of it can be established without the hardware.
